## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Obtain Images

Download the four required Ishihara test plates from a legitimate source.

### 2. Verify Filenames

Ensure your images are named **exactly** as follows:
```
ishihara_1.jpg
ishihara_3.jpg
ishihara_11.jpg
ishihara_19.jpg
```

**Case sensitive!** Use lowercase letters.

### 3. Place in Directory

Copy all four images to:
```
client/src/resources/
```

Your directory structure should look like:
```
client/src/resources/
├── .gitkeep
├── README.md (this file)
├── ishihara_1.jpg
├── ishihara_3.jpg
├── ishihara_11.jpg
└── ishihara_19.jpg
```

### 4. Verify

Run the application and navigate to:
**Perception Lab → Color Blindness Test**

You should see the actual Ishihara plates instead of placeholder circles.

## 🎨 Fallback Behavior

### What Happens Without Images?

If images are not found, the application will:
- ✅ Still function normally
- ✅ Display colored placeholder circles
- ✅ Allow test completion
- ✅ Record all interactions
- ⚠️ Show "Image not found" message

### Troubleshooting

**Images not appearing?**

1. **Check filenames:** Must be exact (lowercase, .jpg extension)
2. **Check location:** Must be in `client/src/resources/`
3. **Check format:** Must be JPEG (.jpg not .jpeg)
4. **Clear cache:** Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. **Restart dev server:** Stop and run `npm run dev` again

**Still not working?**

Check browser console (F12) for image loading errors.

## 📊 Using the Test

### For Accurate Results

1. **Display:** Use on a calibrated monitor if possible
2. **Lighting:** Test in good, consistent lighting
3. **Distance:** Maintain consistent viewing distance (~50cm)
4. **Time:** Don't rush - view each plate for 3-5 seconds
5. **Environment:** Quiet environment, no distractions

### Understanding Results

The test provides:
- **Color Vision Score:** Percentage of correct answers
- **Diagnosis:** Preliminary assessment
  - "Normal" - No color vision deficiency detected
  - "Suspected Red-Green Deficiency" - May indicate color blindness
  - "Inconclusive" - Results unclear

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is NOT a medical diagnosis. Consult an eye care professional for clinical assessment.

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Changing Images

To use different Ishihara plates:

1. **Update filenames** in `colorBlindnessAnalysis.js`:
```javascript
export const ISHIHARA_PLATES = [
  {
    plateId: 1,
    imageName: 'your_new_image_1.jpg',  // Change here
    normalAnswer: '12',
    colorBlindAnswer: '12',
  },
  // ... update others
];
```

2. **Update imports** in `ColorBlindnessTest.jsx`:
```javascript
import yourImage1 from '../../resources/your_new_image_1.jpg';
// ... update imageMap
```

### Adding More Plates

To add additional test plates:

1. Add plate definition in `colorBlindnessAnalysis.js`
2. Import image in `ColorBlindnessTest.jsx`
3. Update progress indicators
4. No backend changes needed!
